# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

The folder for each day contains:
- Task of the day
- Input for the given task
- Code to solve the given task (main file is always "code.py")
- My solutions to the given input

Please note that all task descriptions on the AoC website could've been changed since they were added to this repository to clarify certain passages.
